          I’m a dedicated backend engineer with over three years of hands‑on experience designing and implementing high‑performance, scalable microservices and cloud‑native architectures. I’ve led small teams to deliver real‑time SaaS alarm management systems handling 1,000+ RPS, optimized complex SQL queries from 60 seconds to 0.1 seconds, and architected robust infrastructure on AWS using Cognito, EC2, RDS, KMS, and more. Proficient in Go, Python, and modern DevOps practices—including Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and CI/CD—I apply Domain‑Driven Design and Clean Architecture to ensure code quality and maintainability. I hold a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics, thrive on mentoring teammates, and continuously explore new technologies to drive efficient, reliable backend solutions.
