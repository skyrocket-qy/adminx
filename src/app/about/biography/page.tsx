        I&apos;m a backend engineer with a strong interest in full-stack development, particularly experienced with Go and familiar with frontend technologies like React.



        Go is my primary language, but throughout my learning and working experience, I&apos;ve also worked with Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, and more. While my focus is on backend development, I&apos;ve gained hands-on experience in a broad range of areas â€” including AWS, microservices, and DevOps practices. You can find a more detailed overview of my skills in my attached resume.



        What sets me apart is my proactive learning attitude. I enjoy exploring new technologies, taking on challenges, and adapting quickly to new environments. I&apos;m equally comfortable working independently or collaborating closely with teammates to solve problems efficiently and smoothly.



        Here are a couple of links to my work:

        For more details, please refer to my resume. I&apos;d be happy to answer any questions or provide more information if needed.
